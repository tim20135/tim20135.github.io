              <h2> What is the secondary mission?</h2>
              <p> Our Cansat submission is not limited to just the primary mission, as we have to design our can satellite to accomplish another - secondary - objective. This can be anything you want as long as it provides some useful observation. In our case, we have opted to install solar panels on our can, as well as light intensity sensors. In order to do this, we have had to make several modifications to our can design to accomodate these new features. The solar panels aren't all trouble though, they will feed power into the can's batteries as it descends-- ensuring that we won't run out of electricity.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="bright"> What are we going to do?</h2>  
            <div class="box">
              <p> To install the solar panels onto the can, we have added flaps onto the top of our can where the panels will rest. They are linked using 30mm screws and have premade holes so that the wires from the solar panels can be fed into the internal circuitry. Furthermore, there will be elastic cables between our can and solar panel flaps. The result of this is that they will automatically pop out when the can exits the rocket and reveal the solar panels to as much sunlight as possible. The panels are fairly small and light (less than 80mm wide) and can also help slow down the can on the final descent. One challenge we faced was making a flap design which both had enough structural integrity to not break on initial opening, and that wasnt so thick as to either not fit inside the rocket or to exceed the weight limit allocated to us.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" style="left: 48.5vw;">
              <p style="width: 90%;"> The current (corresponding to the amount of electricity) produced by the solar panels will be measured by components in our can's circuit boards. This on its own has little use for us to study. However, the light intensity sensors also installed on the can will be recording the amount of light hitting the can in tandem to the solar panels. Combining these two measurements with the altitude data already present on our can, we will take all of this information and use python (a coding language) to plot graphs comparing current generated by the solar panels to the light they recieved, as well as the power produced compared to the can's altitude. We will then analyse this data to help us understand how these sorts of conditions affect electricity generation, something which modern space agencies could utilise. </p>
